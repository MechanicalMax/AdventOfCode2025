# Advent of Code 2025
Only 12 days this year, sad but also a relief.
This was always a big time sink right around the holidays, so I'm thankful for the shorter timeframe this year.
I'm switching back to Python for ease of writing and because it has a lot of prebuilt tools for the job.

## Reflection
I enjoyed the simple problems at the beginning, then discovering clever solutions to the more challenging puzzles in the middle. But towards the end (especially after day 8), the problems became too hard to solve without looking online for resources. Using AI for more complex problems is a good practice in modern implementation and problem-solving.

*How do we describe our problems well enough that LLMs can solve them for us?*
